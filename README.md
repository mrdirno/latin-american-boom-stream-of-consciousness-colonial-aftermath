## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a journal entry from Illari's perspective, describing the new priest's arrival and what she sees in his eyes that he cannot.
- Compose a 'whispered name' poem for the river, blending Quechua imagery with Catholic liturgy.
- Draft a letter from the Bishop in the city, responding to a frantic, coded missive from Father Anselmo.
- Write a monologue for the jungle itself, addressing Father Rivas as it slowly 'digests' his mission and his mind.

### Technical Entry Points

- Create an interactive map of Santa Inés where clicking on locations (the riverbank, the mission, the ruins) triggers overlapping audio layers of prayers, indigenous songs, and jungle sounds.
- Build a text generator that mimics the novel's style: input a Catholic doctrinal phrase and receive it 'translated' into a syncretic, stream-of-consciousness jungle reflection.
